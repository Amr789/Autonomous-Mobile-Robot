# Autonomous-Mobile-Robot
This is an Autonomous Mobile Robot
designed to enhance navigation and object handling within a warehouse environment. 
This project involved implementing advanced sensory perception using ultrasonic sensors for 
obstacle detection and RFID technology for precise localization. I designed control algorithms for 
efficient path planning and integrated reinforcement learning (Q-learning) to enable adaptive performance on a Raspberry Pi 4. 
The robot's actions, determined by the reinforcement learning algorithms, are transferred to an Arduino Mega through UART for execution. 
The project culminated in a successful demonstration of the robot's capabilities in navigation, obstacle avoidance, and real-time path adjustment, 
significantly improving operational efficiency and safety.
